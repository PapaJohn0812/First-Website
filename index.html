        <!-- Hey there, this is some secret code. If you find this you win a free iphone. -->
        <p>Did it work? I hope so.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>This is a list</li>
            <li>It puts my text in bullet points</li>
            <li>I can even put <strong>Bold</strong> or <em>italicised</em> words in my list</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heres another list</li>
            <li>Notice anything different?</li>
            <li>This list is ordered by number.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I wonder if I can put paragraphs inside a bullet point list... lets try.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Here is my first paragraph</p><p>Here is my second paragraph</p></li>
            <li>Here is the second bullet point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It worked!</p>
        <p>

        <p>That link is called an <strong>Absolute Link</strong>, as it takes you to a page on an external website.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, we can use a <strong>Relative Link</strong>, which is used to take you to a page on the same directory. Try visitng my <a href="./about.html">about page</a> to see how this works.</p>
        <p>Hmmm this webpage is looking pretty dull right now... lets add a picute of a dog!</p>
